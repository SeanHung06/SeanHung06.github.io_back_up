<p>This is a note for while Learning golang-getting-started in Coursera</p>

<h3 id="compilation">Compilation:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Translate instructions once before running the code → C , C++ , Java(Partially)</li>
  <li>Translation occurs only once → Saves Time</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Translate instructions while code is executed -&gt; Python , Java</li>
  <li>Translation occurs every execution and Requires an interpreter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="garbage-collection">Garbage Collection:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Typically done by interpreters but Go is complied language</li>
  <li>Automatic memory management → compromise between Interpretation and compilation</li>
  <li>Manually memory management → Memory Leak→ which is there are more and more memory that is not being use</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="go-language--weakly-objected-oriented-language">Go Language — Weakly objected oriented language</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Organize your code through encapsulation(封裝)</li>
  <li>Group together data and functions which are related</li>
  <li>Go doesn’t use the term Class → <strong>Instead uses structs with associated methods</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simplified-implementation-of-classes">Simplified implementation of classes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No inheritance</li>
  <li>No constructors</li>
  <li>No generics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="concurrency-in-go">Concurrency in Go</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go includes concurrency primitives</li>
  <li>Goroutines represent concurrent tasks</li>
  <li>Channels are used to communicate between tasks</li>
  <li>Select enables task synchronization</li>
  <li>Concurrency primitives are efficient and easy to use</li>
</ul>
