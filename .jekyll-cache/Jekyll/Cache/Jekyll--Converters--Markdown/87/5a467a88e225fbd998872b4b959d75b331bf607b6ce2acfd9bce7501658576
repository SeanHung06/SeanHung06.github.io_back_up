<p>As I began to set up my own site, I was not a huge fan of the options out there for adding a r√©sum√© or CV to a WordPress blog. Many personal sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can‚Äôt even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.</p>

<h3 id="enter-wp-resume">Enter WP Resume</h3>

<p>WP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your r√©sum√© online and keep it updated. Built on WordPress 3.0‚Äôs custom post type functionality, it offers a uniquely familiar approach to publishing. If you‚Äôve got a WordPress site, you already know how to use WP Resume.</p>

<h3 id="features-include">Features include</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for sections (e.g., education, experience), organizations (e.g., somewhere state university, Cogs, Inc.), positions (e.g., bachelor of arts, chief widget specialist), and details (e.g., grew bottom line by 15%, president of the sustainability club)</li>
  <li>Follows best practices in resume layout and design</li>
  <li>One click install, just start adding content</li>
  <li>Drag and drop ordering of resume elements</li>
  <li>Built on existing WordPress code, utilizing a single custom post type and two custom taxonomies</li>

</ul>

<p>The hardest part of getting your r√©sum√© online should be doing the work listed on it, not wrestling the publishing platform. Simply put, WP Resume steps aside and lets your experience shine.</p>
